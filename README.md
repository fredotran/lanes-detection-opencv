# Lanes detection on images and videos using OpenCV
My first project for road markings lanes detection on images and videos using OpenCV.

This project is about using basics OpenCV's methods in order to detect road's markings (lanes detection) by processing the input image/video. In this repository you'll find an introduction to all these methods and their applications in real-time video.
